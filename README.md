## Introduction
This is a mini-project that I created to improve my skills, so in this project, I try to create a dashboard and seek insights from the data, the BI tool used to create the dashboard is Google Data Studio while the data is obtained from <a href="https://www.jamtangan.com">jamtangan.com</a>. For the data itself I took <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io">Selenium</a> and <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en /latest/">BeautifulSoup</a>, for the programming language used is Python. You can see how I retrieve data and then clean it in the 'main.ipynb' file, then the data that has been saved into a Google Sheet.
